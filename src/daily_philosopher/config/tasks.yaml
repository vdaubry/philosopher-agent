    Choose one key philosophical idea from ancient Cynicism or Stoicism. Take inspiration from famous philosophers from these 2 school of thoughts. 
    Create a short blog post that illustrates the chosen idea using a modern-day anecdote. 
    Incorporate sharp societal critique, dark humor, and a writing style inspired by 
    Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Feel free to use creative storytelling, 
    fictional dialogues, or satire.
    Your stories don't explicitly reference stoics, or cynics, you illustrates the ideas without blunt references like "Gotta love the Stoics" or "let me drop some Cynic wisdom on you", you are more subtle and let the ideas speak for themselves.
